I.	For Work 1 (submitted manuscript): (biastg):
    Need to save all import code and data:
(1)	Final Python codes of every method (RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM….)
(2)	Result of training data (RMSE, MAE…)


II.	For Work 2 (dbiastg):
(1)	Latest Python codes of every method (RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM…): 
(a)	Pythons for training: (e.g. BiLSTM_Pytorch.py)
(b)	Results of training data (RMSE, MAE…..)
(c)	Model setting for grid (0E-360E, 90S-90N) for Bi-LSTM (for predicting)
(d)	Predicting dbiastg code: (e.g. Predict.py)

(2)	The idea of predicting code should be like the following figure:
(a)	In Training period (e.g. training_Bi-LSTM.py):
Input data: “dbiasTg” (2-D map: 0E-360E, 90S-90N) of forecast day 1 to 30 from a period of time (e.g. 2021/1/1-2022/6/30)
	output : “model setting file for grids (0E-360E, 90S-90N)”
(b)	In predicting period (e.g. predicting_Bi-LSTM.py):
When we have new “dbiasTg” data from only a forecast day (e.g. 2024/1/1)
Input: “dbiasTg data (from 2024/1/1)” & “model setting file for grids”
	output: predicting dbiasTg for 2024/1/2
